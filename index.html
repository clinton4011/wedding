            <h2>Groom's Story</h2>
            <p>
              It all started in the month of October 2020 when this new girl
              moved in to a lodge I was also staying. It was time for our
              evening prayers at the lodge and as I led prayers that night, this
              “new girl” started singing and the whole atmosphere became
              charged.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inwardly, I whispered to myself, "I love this grace," after the
              prayers ended, we all introduced ourselves to the New girl.
            </p>
            <p>
              Several weeks had passed since our first encounter when, I spotted
              her wearing a geology T-shirt. Excited by the shared interest
              since I also studied Geology in Uni, I seized the opportunity to
              strike up a conversation with her on the subject. Little did I
              know that this casual encounter would become the catalyst for
              something truly special.
            </p>
            <p>
              We became really close friends and as our friendship blossomed, I
              eventually came to the decision that we should be best friends
              forever.

            <h2>Bride's Story</h2>
            <p>
              In October 2020, I finally received the long-awaited approval from
              my parents to relocate to Akure, as the Lord had already
              instructed me about my impending move in the previous year. During
              that year, my friend was planning her wedding, so she offered me
              her place to stay pending when I would find a new place since her
              rent had not yet expired.
            </p>
            <p>
              The very day I got to Akure, at the lodge where my friend stayed,
              another mutual friend of ours invited me for a prayer meeting that
              regularly held at the lodge. Reluctantly, I joined although I was
              very tired from the journey.
            </p>
            <p>
              That evening, there was this young man who led the prayer session
              with so much passion and unwavering authority. The moment I saw
              this young man, something leaped in my heart and there was a
              knowing in my spirit that this is my husband but I wondered how
              this shall be since there was someone else I was already planning
              to say “Yes” to.
            </p>
            <p>
              At first the 'young man' was very unfriendly (or so I assumed) of
              all the others who stayed at the lodge so I quickly discarded
              every prompting I had in my spirit towards him until one day — the
              day he engaged me in a conversation upon seeing me in a “geology”
              inscribed t-shirt…
            </p>
            <p>
              Till date, we have never gone a day without talking to each other.
              The rest they say is history...s
